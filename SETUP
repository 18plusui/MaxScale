Installation and startup

Simply set the environment variable MAXSCALE_HOME to point at this
directory and LD_LIBRARY_PATH tp include $MAXSCALE_HOME/lib.

Becasue we need the libmysqld library for parsing two files from
MariaDB are required. Copy the my.cnf to /etc and errmsg.sys to
/usr/local/mysql/share/english.

To start the gateway execute the command $MAXSCALE_HOME/bin/maxscale.

Configuration

You need to edit the file MaxScale.cnf in $MAXSCALE_HOME/etc, you should
define the set of server definitions you require, with the addresses
and ports of those servers. Also define the listening ports for your
various services.

In order to view the internal activity of the gateway you can telnet to
the port defined for the telnet listener. Initially you may login with
the user name of "admin" and the password "skysql". Once connected type
help for an overview of the commands and help <command> for the more
detailed help on commands. Use the add user command to add a new user,
this will also remove the admin/skysql user.
