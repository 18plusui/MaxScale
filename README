/** \mainpage SkySQL Gateway

The SkySQL Gateway is an intelligent proxy that allows forwarding of
database statements to one or more database server user complex rules
and a semantic understanding of the database satements and the roles of
the various servers within the backend cluster of databases.

The Gateway is designed to provided load balancing and high avilability
functionality transparantly to the applications. In addition it provides
a highly scalable and flexibile architecture, with plugin components to
support differnt protocols and routing decissions.

The Gateway is implemented in C and makes entensive use of the
asynchronous I/O capabilities of the Linux operating system. The epoll
system is used to provide the event driven framework for the input and
output via sockets.

The protocols are implemented as external shared object modules which
can be loaded and runtime. These modules support a fixed interface,
communicating the entries points via a structure consisting of a set of
function pointers. This structured is called the "module object".

The code that routes the queries to the database servers is also loaed
as external shared objects and are referred to as routing modules.
