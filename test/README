Source tree structure and test targets for make. In a given source directory, 
MAXSCALE_HOME/server, for example, there is a test directory which includes 
tests for that directory ('local tests') and targets for every subdirectory 
of MAXSCALE_HOME/server.

In the outline below, target, such as 'cleantest' includes instructions for 
executing tests or make command pointing to subdirectories. If target is 
followed by colon and a list of directory names ('cleantest:log_manager, 
query_classifier'), the target is executed locally and in the listed 
directories. 

Note : add new tests for any component as close to the actual implementation 
as possible. For example, DCB tests in MAXSCALE_HOME/server/core/test instead 
of MAXSCALE_HOME/server/test etc.
